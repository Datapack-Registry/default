This repository keeps track of Minecrafts generated default data for a datapack vor every version. Every 12 hours a check is made to see if there is a new Minecraft version. If a new version is available, it will be published on the `generated` branch with the respective tag of the version.

Individual files can be accessed by the respective version tag:
```url
https://github.com/Datapack-Registry/default/blob/<version>/<path to file>?raw=true
```

### See also

## Disclaimer
This repository assumes that because Mojang intentionally provides a public API for downloading the `client.jar`, they have no objection to the resulting generated data existing anywhere on the internet for public consumption. If this assumption is ever contradicted, the repository will be removed immediately.
